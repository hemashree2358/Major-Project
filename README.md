The COVID-19 pandemic forced educational institutions to shift from traditional in-person exams to online assessments. However, existing online proctoring systems suffer from limitations such as poor accuracy, lack of real-time monitoring, and privacy concerns. This project presents an Intelligent Online Proctoring System that improves user authentication and detects abnormal behavior during exams. The system utilizes advanced techniques like face verification, face spoofing detection, head pose estimation, eye tracking, and mouth movement analysis to ensure a fair and secure online examination environment.
